  # Storybook

  If you're building UI components, it's likely you want to have a development
  environment to test different permutations of your components by actually
  using them. The React ecosystem came up with a fantastic tool called
  [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org). If you haven't heard of it, you should
  check it out. However, if you're here, it's likely you have, but you might be
  wondering how you can use it with web components.

  ### Getting set up

  You'll want to install React (or one of the other supported frameworks) first
  so that the \`getstorybook\` command works.

  ~~~
  npm i react react-dom
  ~~~

  Then you can follow their instructions
  [here](https://storybook.js.org/basics/quick-start-guide/) to set up
  Storybook.

  ### Boilerplate

  Once you're all set up, you'll end up with a file called
  \`stories/index.stories.js\`. When you open it you'll probably see a bunch of
  boilerplate. Blow it all away and replace it with this:

  ~~~js
  import React from "react";
  import { storiesOf } from "@storybook/react";
  ~~~

  ### Initial configuration

  Before we start coding in this file, we're going to set up our environment
  assuming that the browser we're testing in has native support for Custom
  Elements and Shadow DOM. Since Storybook transpiles everything to ES5 by
  default, we need to add the
  [Custom Elements ES5 adapter](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs#custom-elements-es5-adapterjs).
  To do this, we create a file called
  [\`.storybook/preview-head.html\`](https://storybook.js.org/configurations/add-custom-head-tags/)
  and put the following in it:

  ~~~html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@1.0.22/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js"></script>
  ~~~

  This ensures that the adapter is loaded in your UI frame before your
  application code. If you don't do this, you'll get an error that says
  something like:

  > Uncaught TypeError: Failed to construct 'HTMLElement': Please use the 'new'
  > operator, this DOM object constructor cannot be called as a function.

  ### Our test component

  Now that our environment is all set up, we can start coding a test component
  that's pretty simple. The goal here is to show how to set up Storybook, not
  necessarily build a complex component.

  Before we start writing our component we need to install a few things:

  1. SkateJS - _duh!_
  2. [LitHTML](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/lit-html) - we want to show how to
     use something besides React, inside of a React dev tool.
  3. The [SkateJS renderer for LitHTML](/renderers/with-lit-html) - just ties
     LitHTML into Skate.

  ~~~js
  npm i skatejs @skatejs/element-lit-html lit-html
  ~~~

  Once those are installed, we can start writing out component. For the sake of
  simplicity, we'll just put this in the story file that was created for us. If
  you were setting up a dev environment for yourself, you'd probably be putting
  this in a separate directory and importing it.

  ~~~js
  import { define, withComponent } from "skatejs";
  import withLitHtml from "@skatejs/element-lit-html";
  import { html } from "lit-html/lib/lit-extended";

  const Hello = define(class extends withComponent(withLitHtml()) {
    render() {
      return html\`
        Hello, <strong><slot>World</slot></strong
        >!
      \`;
    }
  });
  ~~~

  If you're not familiar with how renderers work, see the
  [docs on renderers](/renderers).

  ### Writing the stories

  Before we write our stories, let's enable a few things in React:

  1. Prefer setting properties (React sets attributes).
  2. Make custom events work.
  3. Make passing the custom element constructor as the JSX element tag name
     just work. Using this along with Skate's
     [\`define()\`](http://localhost:8080/utils/define) utility makes HMR work
     out of the box.

  To do this, we can use [\`@skatejs/val\`](https://github.com/skatejs/val).
  First install it:

  ~~~
  npm i @skatejs/val
  ~~~

  And then all you have to do is import it and patch \`React.createElement\`:

  ~~~js
  // @jsx h

  import val from "@skatejs/val";

  const h = val(React.createElement);
  ~~~

  This now makes writing our stories easier:

  ~~~js
  storiesOf("Hello", module)
    .add("with no name", () => <Hello />)
    .add("with a name", () => <Hello>You</Hello>);
  ~~~

  ### Summing up

  Your story file should now look something like:

  ~~~js
  // @jsx h

  import React from "react";
  import { storiesOf } from "@storybook/react";

  import { define, withComponent } from "skatejs";
  import withLitHtml from "@skatejs/element-lit-html";
  import { html } from "lit-html/lib/lit-extended";

  import val from "@skatejs/val";

  const h = val(React.createElement);

  const Hello = define(class extends withComponent(withLitHtml()) {
    render() {
      return html\`
        Hello, <strong><slot>World</slot></strong
        >!
      \`;
    }
  });

  storiesOf("Hello", module)
    .add("with no name", () => <Hello />)
    .add("with a name", () => <Hello>You</Hello>);
  ~~~

  You should now have a fully functional Storybook dev environment that you can
  use to develop your custom elements.

  From here, you'd probably want to pull the component out into its own file and
  import it into your story. You'd probably also want to pull the patching of
  \`React.createElement\` out into it's own module, as well.

  ### Using Storybook without Skate (vanilla custom elements)

  What's interesting about this is you could remove the Skate parts and
  everything would still just work because all Skate does is make it easier to
  write a vanilla custom element. Removing Skate and replacing the test
  component with a vanilla custom element would look something like this:

  ~~~js
  // @jsx h

  import React from "react";
  import { storiesOf } from "@storybook/react";

  import val from "@skatejs/val";

  const h = val(React.createElement);

  class Hello extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
    }
    connectedCallback() {
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = \`Hello, <strong><slot>World</slot></strong>!\`;
    }
  }

  customElements.define("x-hello", Hello);

  storiesOf("Hello", module)
    .add("with no name", () => <Hello />)
    .add("with a name", () => <Hello>You</Hello>);
  ~~~

  You lose some possibly important features, such as HMR support because you can
  only register a custom element with the same name once, and this would try to
  do it multiple times. However, this goes to show that custom elements are the
  glue that allows you to share components across frameworks; the DOM is your
  abstraction layer.
